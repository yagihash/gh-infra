Export existing repository settings as YAML. Useful for bootstrapping gh-infra configuration from an existing repository.

```bash
gh infra import <owner/repo> [owner/repo ...]
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Example | Behavior |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `<owner/repo>` | `gh infra import babarot/my-project` | Import that repository |
| Multiple repos | `gh infra import babarot/my-project babarot/my-cli` | Import each repository |

When using `--into`, arguments are optional. If omitted, all repositories defined in the manifests are targeted.

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--into <path>` | Pull GitHub state into existing local manifests (directory or file path) |

## Examples

```bash
# Import and save to a file
gh infra import babarot/my-project > repos/my-project.yaml

# Import multiple repositories
gh infra import babarot/my-project babarot/my-cli

# Import and review
gh infra import babarot/my-project

# Pull GitHub state into existing manifests (specific repo)
gh infra import babarot/my-project --into=repos/my-project.yaml

# Pull GitHub state for all repos defined in manifests
gh infra import --into=repos/
```

The output is a complete `Repository` YAML manifest reflecting the current state of the repository on GitHub.

## `--into`: Pull GitHub State into Local Manifests

With `--into`, import works in the reverse direction of `plan`/`apply`: it fetches the current GitHub state and updates your existing local YAML manifests to match.

```bash
# Import specific repos into manifests
gh infra import <owner/repo> [owner/repo ...] --into=<path>

# Import all repos defined in manifests
gh infra import --into=<path>
```

The path can be a single YAML file or a directory containing manifests.

When no `owner/repo` arguments are given, all repositories defined in the manifests (from Repository, RepositorySet, and FileSet resources) are targeted automatically.

### How It Works

1. **Parse** local manifests at the given path
2. **Match** targets to resources in the manifests — either from arguments or all repos in manifests when no arguments are given
3. **Fetch** the current state from GitHub (in parallel)
4. **Diff** local vs GitHub, field by field
5. **Display** the plan (repo setting changes + file changes with diff stats)
6. **Confirm** with interactive diff viewer (for file changes) or simple prompt (repo-only changes)
7. **Write** approved changes to local files

### Examples

```bash
# Pull GitHub state for all repos defined in manifests
gh infra import --into=repos/

# Pull GitHub state into a specific manifest file
gh infra import babarot/my-project --into=repos/my-project.yaml

# Pull from a directory of manifests
gh infra import babarot/my-project --into=repos/

# Import multiple repositories at once
gh infra import babarot/my-project babarot/my-cli --into=repos/
```

### Interactive Diff Viewer

After the plan is displayed, the confirmation prompt offers three options:

```
> Apply import changes? (y)es / (n)o / (d)iff
```

Press `d` to open a full-screen diff viewer for file-level changes:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑`/`↓` or `j`/`k` | Select file |
| `Tab` | Cycle `write` / `patch` / `skip` for the selected file |
| `d`/`u` | Scroll diff pane |
| `q`/`Esc` | Return to confirmation |

Repository setting changes (description, visibility, features, etc.) are shown in the terminal plan output, not in the diff viewer.

### `write` / `patch` / `skip`

The import diff viewer does not just let you approve or reject a file change. For each file, you can choose how the change should be written back:

- `write`
  - update the file's normal write-back target
  - inline entries update the manifest `content: |` block
  - source-backed entries update the local source file
- `patch`
  - store the drift as a manifest patch under `patches:`
- `skip`
  - do not apply that file change in this import run

The default action depends on the file shape:

| File shape | Default | Allowed |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Inline content | `write` | `write`, `skip` |
| Local source (single-use) | `write` | `write`, `patch`, `skip` |
| Local source shared by multiple repos | `patch` | `write`, `patch`, `skip` |
| Existing `patches:` entry | `patch` | `write`, `patch`, `skip` |
| Simple `<% .Repo.* %>` substitutions | `write`/`patch`/`skip` based on file shape | shown in viewer |
| Files whose remote content cannot be safely written back to the template | skipped in plan | not shown in viewer |
| `github://` source | skipped in plan | not shown in viewer |

This is especially useful for shared source files:

- the safe default is `patch`, so one repo's drift does not immediately rewrite the shared source
- but if you intentionally want to update the shared source/template itself, switch that entry to `write`

There are two kinds of skip behavior:

- hard skip: the file cannot be written back safely, so it is shown only in the plan with a skip reason
- default skip: the file is skipped by default, but you can press `Tab` in the diff viewer to switch to `write` or `patch`

For example, files with `reconcile: create_only` default to `skip`, while files whose remote content cannot be safely written back to the template are hard-skipped.

### Hard Skip vs Default Skip

These two skip modes mean very different things:

- default skip
  - the file is importable
  - gh-infra chooses `skip` as the safest default for this run
  - you can still press `Tab` and switch to `write` or `patch`
- hard skip
  - gh-infra could not produce a safe local write-back result
  - the file is shown in the terminal plan only
  - it does not appear in the diff viewer and cannot be toggled

In practice:

- `reconcile: create_only` files are usually **default skip**
- `github://` sources are always **hard skip**
- template-backed files may be either:
  - importable, if gh-infra can preserve placeholders and safely apply only the literal drift
  - hard-skipped, if the remote file can no longer be mapped back to the original template without risk

### Template-Backed Files

For files containing gh-infra template placeholders such as `<% .Repo.Name %>` or `<% .Repo.FullName %>`, import does **not** compare the raw template source directly against the GitHub file.

Instead, gh-infra:

1. renders the local template for the target repository
2. compares that rendered content with the GitHub file
3. tries to reconstruct updated template source while preserving the original placeholders

This means simple cases can be imported safely. For example:

- `module github.com/<% .Repo.FullName %>` can stay templated while nearby literal lines such as `go 1.26.1` are updated
- `/<% .Repo.Name %>` can still be preserved if only the surrounding punctuation changes in a safe way

However, gh-infra hard-skips a template-backed file when the remote file no longer has a structure that can be safely mapped back to the original template. Typical examples are:

- the remote file removed or rewrote the placeholder-backed lines entirely
- the remote file changed placeholder-derived content in a way that is ambiguous to reverse
- the template uses unsupported control flow or complex template syntax

So the rule of thumb is:

- if placeholders are still recognizable and only literal drift changed, import can usually proceed
- if the remote file effectively stopped looking like the original template, gh-infra hard-skips it

For implementation details and exact safety rules, see [Import Into Manifests](../internals/import-into/).

### What Gets Imported

| Resource | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| Repository settings | Field-by-field comparison and YAML patch |
| RepositorySet entries | Minimal override reconstruction (preserves defaults/override separation) |
| Files with local source (`source: ./path`) | Local file overwritten with GitHub content |
| Files with inline content (`content: \|`) | YAML content block updated in-place |
| Files with `reconcile: create_only` | Imported (updates the local master template for future repos) |

### What Gets Skipped

| Source | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| Files whose remote content cannot be safely written back to the template | The remote content cannot be mapped back to the original template source without risking an incorrect rewrite |
| Files from GitHub source (`source: github://...`) | No local file to write back to |
| Secrets | GitHub API does not return secret values; local values are preserved |

Skipped files are shown in the plan output with a warning icon and the skip reason displayed dimmed.

### Shared Source Files

When a source file is shared across multiple repositories in a FileSet, the default import action is `patch`, not `write`.

This means:

- by default, drift from one repository is captured in manifest patches
- the shared source file is left unchanged
- other repositories are not affected immediately

If you intentionally want to make the shared source authoritative and propagate that change, switch the entry to `write` in the diff viewer.
