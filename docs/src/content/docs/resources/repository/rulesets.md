Configure [GitHub repository rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets) — the modern replacement for classic branch protection rules, with richer controls and enforcement modes.

:::note
Rulesets and `branch_protection` are independent features. You can use either or both. Classic branch protection uses the [Branch Protection API](../branch-protection/), while rulesets use the [Repository Rulesets API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules).
:::

:::caution[GitHub Free plan limitation]
Repository rulesets are **not available** for private repositories on the GitHub Free plan. On Free plan private repos:

- **`import`** silently omits rulesets from the exported manifest (the Rulesets API returns HTTP 403).
- **`plan` / `apply`** will fail with an API error if your manifest contains `rulesets` for a Free plan private repo.

To use rulesets on private repositories, upgrade to GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, or GitHub Enterprise. Alternatively, use classic [`branch_protection`](../branch-protection/) on public repositories.

## Example

```yaml
spec:
  rulesets:
    - name: protect-main
      target: branch
      enforcement: active
      bypass_actors:
        - role: admin
          bypass_mode: always
      conditions:
        ref_name:
          include:
            - "refs/heads/main"
            - "refs/heads/release/*"
          exclude:
            - "refs/heads/sandbox/*"
      rules:
        pull_request:
          required_approving_review_count: 1
          dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push: true
          require_code_owner_review: false
          require_last_push_approval: false
          required_review_thread_resolution: false
        required_status_checks:
          strict_required_status_checks_policy: true
          contexts:
            - context: "ci/test"
              app: github-actions
        non_fast_forward: true
        deletion: true
        creation: false
        required_linear_history: false
        required_signatures: false

    - name: protect-tags
      target: tag
      enforcement: evaluate
      conditions:
        ref_name:
          include: ["refs/tags/v*"]
      rules:
        deletion: true
        non_fast_forward: true
```

## Top-level Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | string | *required* | Ruleset name (must be unique within the repository) |
| `target` | string | `branch` | What the ruleset applies to: `branch` or `tag` |
| `enforcement` | string | `active` | `active` (enforced), `evaluate` (dry-run, logged but not enforced), or `disabled` |
| `bypass_actors` | list | `[]` | Actors who can bypass this ruleset |
| `conditions` | object | — | Which branches or tags the ruleset applies to |
| `rules` | object | *required* | The rules to enforce |

## Bypass Actors

Each entry allows a specific actor to bypass the ruleset. Specify the actor type by field name:

```yaml
bypass_actors:
  - role: admin              # Built-in role: admin, write, or maintain
    bypass_mode: always
  - team: maintainers        # Organization team by slug
    bypass_mode: pull_request
  - app: github-actions      # GitHub App by slug
    bypass_mode: always
  - org-admin: true          # Organization administrators
  - custom-role: reviewer    # Enterprise Cloud custom role by name
    bypass_mode: pull_request
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `role` | Built-in repository role: `admin`, `write`, or `maintain` |
| `team` | Organization team slug (resolved via API) |
| `app` | GitHub App slug (resolved via API) |
| `org-admin` | Set to `true` for organization administrators |
| `custom-role` | Enterprise Cloud custom role name (resolved via API) |
| `bypass_mode` | `always` (pushes and PRs) or `pull_request` (PRs only) |

Exactly one actor type field must be specified per entry. Names are automatically resolved to numeric IDs — see [Ruleset Identity Resolution](../../internals/ruleset-identity-resolution/) for details.

## Conditions

Specify which branches or tags the ruleset targets using `fnmatch`-style patterns:

```yaml
conditions:
  ref_name:
    include:
      - "refs/heads/main"
      - "refs/heads/release/*"
    exclude:
      - "refs/heads/sandbox/*"
```

Special values: `~DEFAULT_BRANCH` matches the repository's default branch, `~ALL` matches all branches/tags.

## Rules

### `pull_request`

Require pull request reviews before merging:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `required_approving_review_count` | int | `0` | Number of required approving reviews (0–10) |
| `dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push` | bool | `false` | Dismiss approvals when new commits are pushed |
| `require_code_owner_review` | bool | `false` | Require review from code owners |
| `require_last_push_approval` | bool | `false` | Last pusher cannot self-approve |
| `required_review_thread_resolution` | bool | `false` | All review threads must be resolved |

### `required_status_checks`

Require specific CI checks to pass:

```yaml
rules:
  required_status_checks:
    strict_required_status_checks_policy: true
    contexts:
      - context: "ci/test"
        app: github-actions
      - context: "ci/lint"
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `strict_required_status_checks_policy` | bool | Require branch to be up to date before merging |
| `contexts[].context` | string | Name of the required status check |
| `contexts[].app` | string | *(optional)* GitHub App slug that must provide this check. Omit to accept any provider |

### Toggle Rules

Simple on/off rules — set to `true` to enable:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `non_fast_forward` | Block force pushes to matching refs |
| `deletion` | Block deletion of matching refs |
| `creation` | Block creation of matching refs |
| `required_linear_history` | Require linear commit history (no merge commits) |
| `required_signatures` | Require signed commits |

## Rulesets vs Classic Branch Protection

| Feature | Classic `branch_protection` | `rulesets` |
|---------|----------------------------|------------|
| Multiple rules per branch | No (one rule per pattern) | Yes (rules stack) |
| Enforcement modes | On/off only | Active, evaluate (dry-run), disabled |
| Bypass control | Admin override only | Granular per role/team/app |
| Tag protection | No | Yes (`target: tag`) |
| Audit trail | No | Built-in version history |
| Merge queue | Separate config | Integrated as a rule type (Phase 2) |
| Metadata rules | No | Commit message patterns, etc. (Phase 2) |
