title: Apply Strategy
---

The apply strategy controls **how** file changes are committed to target repositories.

## `direct` (default)

Commits directly to the default branch using the Git Data API. All files are included in a single atomic commit.

```yaml
spec:
  strategy: direct
```

Use this when you trust the changes and want them applied immediately — for example, syncing a LICENSE or CODEOWNERS that doesn't need review.

## `pull_request`

Creates a branch, commits all files, and opens a pull request. Reviewers can inspect the diff before merging.

```yaml
spec:
  strategy: pull_request
  commit_message: "ci: sync shared files"
  # branch: gh-infra/custom-branch   # optional, auto-generated if omitted
```

Use this when changes need review — for example, updating CI workflows that could break builds if something is wrong.

## How to Choose

| Scenario | Recommended strategy |
|----------|---------------------|
| Updating LICENSE, CODEOWNERS, SECURITY.md | `direct` — low risk, no review needed |
| Updating CI workflows, Dockerfiles | `pull_request` — changes could break things |
| Initial rollout to many repos | `pull_request` — lets each team review |
| Routine sync of already-reviewed templates | `direct` — the template was already reviewed |

## Empty Repositories

For repositories with no commits yet, gh-infra automatically falls back to the Contents API regardless of the strategy setting. This creates one commit per file as the initial commit.
