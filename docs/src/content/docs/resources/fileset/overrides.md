title: Per-repo Overrides
---

Each repository in a `FileSet` receives the same set of files. Overrides let you customize specific files for specific repos while keeping the rest consistent.

```yaml
spec:
  repositories:
    - my-cli
    - name: gh-infra
      overrides:
        - path: .github/CODEOWNERS
          content: |
            * @babarot @co-maintainer

  files:
    - path: .github/CODEOWNERS
      content: |
        * @babarot
    - path: LICENSE
      source: ./templates/LICENSE
```

In this example, `my-cli` gets the default CODEOWNERS (`* @babarot`), while `gh-infra` gets a customized version with an additional maintainer. Both repos receive the same LICENSE.

## How Overrides Work

An override replaces the matching file entry (matched by `path`) for that repository only. The override must specify `path` and either `content` or `source`, just like a regular file entry.

Files without a matching override are unchanged — they use the default from the `files` list.

## Vars Inheritance

If an override doesn't specify `vars`, it inherits the `vars` from the original file entry:

```yaml
spec:
  repositories:
    - my-cli
    - name: special-repo
      overrides:
        - path: Makefile
          vars:
            binary_name: "special-binary"   # overrides the default

  files:
    - path: Makefile
      source: ./templates/Makefile
      vars:
        binary_name: "<% .Repo.Name %>"     # default for all repos
```

- `my-cli` uses `binary_name: "my-cli"` (from the template expansion of `<% .Repo.Name %>`)
- `special-repo` uses `binary_name: "special-binary"` (from the override)
